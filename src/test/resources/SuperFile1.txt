I write to you - what is more?
What else can I say?
Now, I know, in your will
It's contempt to punish me.
But you, to my unfortunate share
At least a drop of pity, keeping
You won't leave me.
At first I wanted to remain silent;
Believe me: my shame
You would never know,
When I Had Hope
At least rarely, at least a week times
In our village see you,
Just to hear your speeches,
You have the word to pray, and then
Everything to think about, thinking about one
And day and night before the new meeting.
But they say you're inhumane;
In the wilderness, in the village you are bored,
And we... we do not shine anything,
Although you are glad to be simple-minded.

Why did you visit us?
In the wilderness of the forgotten village
I would never know you,
I didn't know bitter anguish.
Souls of inexperienced excitement
Smiriv with time (how to know?),
In my heart I would find a friend,
Would be a faithful spouse
And a virtuous mother.

Other!.. No, no one in the world
I wouldn't give my heart!
That in the top is destined for advice...
That will of heaven: I am yours;
My whole life was collateral
Dating the faithful with you;
I know you're sent to me by God,
Before the coffin, you're my guardian...
You were in my dreams,
Invisible, you were nice to me,
Your wonderful gaze languished me,
In the soul, your voice was heard
A long time ago... No, it wasn't a dream!
You walked in a little bit, I found out,
All dumped, dusted
And in her thoughts she prayed: here he is!
Isn't that true? I heard you:
You spoke to me in silence,
When I helped the poor
Or I enjoyed the prayer
The longing of an anxious soul?
And at this very moment
Aren't you, nice vision,
In transparent darkness flashed,
Did you come quiet to the head?
Not you, with joy and love,
Did you whisper words of hope to me?
Who are you, my angel or guardian,
Or an insidious craftsman:
Resolve my doubts.

Maybe it's all empty,
Cheating an inexperienced soul!
And destined to be completely different...
But so be it! My Destiny
From now on, I give you,
Before you are tears of lew,
I beg your defense...
Imagine: I'm alone here,
No one understands me,
My mind is exhausting,
And I have to die silently.
I am waiting for you: with a single eye
Hope hearts revive,
Il sleep heavy rupture,
Alas, a well-deserved breaker!

I'm running out! It's scary to recount...
Shame and fear fade...
But I am entrusted with your honor,
And I boldly entrust myself to her...
